program Design, Algorithm, Pseucode, and IOP
1. Create a busic application
your  6 your old client needs an application that will receive an integer from the user banging on the keyboard, add 5 to it, double it, subtract it, and display the result to the screen.
A) Define the problem by constracting an algorithm using pseudocode
Algorithm: result = X+5*2-7
pseudocode:
1.Prompt user for numerical input
2.Get "x" our numerical input
3.Apply algorithm specified (X+5*2-7)
4.Output result
B) Create an IPO diagram showing input, output, and processing step
Input:numberinput, value from the user
Process: apply the algorithm (result = X+5*2-7)
Output: result
C) what control structures (sequence, selction, reputation)
sequence
D)What variables are required?
input variable (numberInput) and output variable result
F)Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test case
numberInput = 5
result = (5+5)*2-7=13
numberInput=10
result = (10+5)*2-7=33
2.His little sister now wants a program to read three numbers, add them together and print their total.
Algorithm: result = X+Y+Z
pseudocode:
1. Prompt user for numerical input(3)
2.Get "x,y,z" our numerical input
3.Apply algorithm specified (X+Y+Z)
4.Output result
B) Create an IPO diagram showing input, output, and processing step
Input: three numerical value from user
Process:   X+Y+Z
Output: result
C) what control structures (sequence, selction, reputation)
sequence
D)What variables are required?
1stNumberInput
2ndNumberInput
3rdNumberInput
F)Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test case
numberInput = 1,2,3
result = 1+2+3=6
numberInput=3,4,5
result = 3+4+5=12
3. A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores, calculate the average score and display the result to the screen. The average score is calculated as the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.
Algorithm: result= average score = Sum of the scores/10
pseudocode:
1. Prompt user for score to put numerical value ten times
2.add all the score
3.Get "Sum of the scores"
4.Apply algorithm specified (Sum of the scores/10)
5.Output result
B) Create an IPO diagram showing input, output, and processing step
Input: three numberinput
Process: apply the algorithm (average score = Sum scores/10)
Output: result
C) what control structures (sequence, selection, reputation)
sequence
reputation
D)What variables are required?
ten input score and the sum of the score
F)Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test case
numberInput= 2,5,4,8,10,3,6,3,7,9 
Sum of the scores= 57
result = 57/10=5.7
numberInput= 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
Sum of the scores =55
result = 55/10=5.5
4. How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?
To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).
Algorithm: result1=(X")*(y")= J
           result2=J*I = K
           result3=K/231
pseudocode:
1. Prompt user for dimantion of the roof input
2.get dimention footprint of roof  x,y
3.Conver to x,y to inches 
4.Apply algorithm1 specified ((X")*(y"))=J
5. get result1 J
6.Get "inches of rain" numerical input = I
7.Apply algorithm2 specified (J*I)=K
8.Get result2 K
8.Apply algorithm3 specified (K/231)
9.Output result
B) Create an IPO diagram showing input, output, and processing step
Input:numberinput, value from the user
Process: apply the three algorithm 
Output: result3
C) what control structures (sequence, selction, reputation)
sequence
selection
D)What variables are required?
Dimantion of the roof input and inches of rain
F)Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test case
Dimantion of the roof X=30'   Y=12'
         J=(360)*(144)=51840
inches of rain I=0.5
         K=J*I=2592
result K/231=2592/231=112.207
Dimantion of the roof X=66   Y=70
          J=(792)*(840)= 
inches of rain I=2
            K=J*I=1330560
result K/231=1330560/231=5760
